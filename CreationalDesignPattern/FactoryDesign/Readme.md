The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It encapsulates object creation logic in a separate method, promoting loose coupling between the creator and the created objects. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact types of objects to be created may vary or need to be determined at runtime, enabling flexibility and extensibility in object creation.
