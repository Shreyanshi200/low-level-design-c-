<h1>Creational Design Pattern</h1>
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
There are two recurring themes in these patterns:
<ul>
  <li>They all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system uses.</li>
  <li>They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.</li>
</ul>
