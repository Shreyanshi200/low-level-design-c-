A singleton class is a special type of class in object-oriented programming which can have only one object or instance at a time. In other words, we can instantiate only one instance of the singleton class. The new variable also points to the initial instance created if we attempt to instantiate the Singleton class after the first time.
<h2>Steps to Implement Singleton Class in C++</h2>

<li>Make all the constructors of the class private.</li>
<li>Delete the copy constructor of the class.</li>
<li>Make a private static pointer that can point to the same class object (singleton class).</li>
<li>Make a public static method that returns the pointer to the same class object (singleton class).</li>
