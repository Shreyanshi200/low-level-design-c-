Its a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and allows them to be used interchangeably within a context.This pattern enables the lgorithm to be selected at runtime,providing flexibility and promoting code reusablility.
<h3>Characteristics of the Strategy Design Pattern?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>It defines a family of algorithms:</b>The pattern allows you to encapsulate multiple algorithms or behaviors into separate classes, known as strategies.</li
  <li>It encapsulates behaviors</li>
  <li>It enables dynamic behavior switching</li>
  <li>It promotes object collaboration</li>
</ul>:
