<h1>Behavioral Design Pattern</h1>
There are three recurring themes in these patterns:
<ul>
  <li>Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.</li>
  <li>Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.</li>
  <li>Behavioral object patterns are concerned with encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.</li>                                                                               
</ul>
